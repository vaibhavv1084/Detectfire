digital system - interconnection -digital hardware modules 
modules - registers , decoders , arithmetic elements , control logic 
various modules are - interconnected - common data , contol paths - to form digital computer system 
digital modules are defined by the registers they contain and the operations that are performed on the data stored in them
operations executed on data stored in registers is called microopertations
micropertions is an elementary operation performed on the information stored in one or kore registers 

REGISTER TRANSFER LANGUAGE -
symbolic notation used to describe the micr operation among the register is RTL

use of symbol instead of notaions explanation provides organized and good manner foe listing the sequences of ther registers 
and control function initiates them

   REGISTERS
computer registers are designed by upper case letters to denote the function of the register followed by digits or letters if needed 

every register holds a address for the memory unit called MAR

other disignation registers are PC , IR , R1 (for processor unit)

   REGISTER TRANSFER
information tranfer from one register to another register in symbolic form by a means of a replacement operator 

the statement R2 <-R1 denotes content of register R1 is transferred to R2

predefined control statement    if(P=1) then R2<-R1

we can separate the control variables with register transfer operation by control function 

  3- STATE BUFFER
has 3 states -  Logic 0 = low signals
                Logic 1 = high signals
                High- Impedence = open circuit 
Normal input - where the signal to be sent to wat output is applied
Control input - determines whether the buffer`s output is active or high impedence 
Ex-
Suppose they are 4 buffers , decoder will select signal control by saying which buffer is active so if i want to send data from buffer 2 then only buffer 2 is enabled while other are kept in high impedence

  MEMORY TRANSFER
Read operation - when u get to read the existing data from the memory and use it to send it to a register or processor
Write operation - when u add a new data into the memory 

when u r reading or writing we should know which memory address are v specifying to - so memory address is important 

registers are small storage areas-
Address Regiester(AR)- holds the address of the memory word u want to read or write
Data Register(DR)- temporarily holds the data that u r reading from or writng it 

DR <-M[AR] means ..the data stored in the address of AR put in into DR for Reading.
M[AR] -> R1 means .. the data stored in R1 sud be stored in the address of AR for Writing.

 ARITHEMETIC MICRO OPERATIONS
~Addition - adding two numbers
~Subtraction - Subtracting one no. from another no.
~Increment - Adding one no. by one
~Decrement - Subtractiong one no. by one
~Shift - move bits left or right

Implenting micro operators-
Full Adder - Adds two bits and carry a bit like normal addition add and carry
Binary Adder - Combines all the full adders for larger addition of binary numbers

Binary Adder and Subtractor - Uses -OR(XOR) gate to control addition or subtracting
  - if mode input M is 0 then circuit acts as adder 
  - if mode input M is 1 then circuit acts as subtractor by complementing one of the inputs
